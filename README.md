# To predict side effects of drug on patients by using Neural Network with TensorFlow's Keras API

An experimental drug was tested on individuals from ages 13 to 100 in a clinical trial. Around 95% of patients , 65 or older experienced side effects. Around 95 % of patients under 65 experienced no side effects.
